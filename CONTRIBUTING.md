## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful&mdash;thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` branch in the repository.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are extremely welcome. However, first consider if your idea is
within the scope and aims of this project. In the end, it's up to **you** to make
a strong case to convince me of the merits of this feature. Please provide as
much detail and context as possible.
